## Technical Reconnaissance

### HTTP Testing Methodology - Two-Phase Approach

**Phase 1: Browser Header Extraction**
Used Playwright MCP to extract authentic browser session data from https://sokoglam.com:

**Extracted Headers:**
```
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) HeadlessChrome/139.0.7258.5 Safari/537.36
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
Connection: keep-alive
```

**Session Cookies Captured:**
- `localization=US`
- `cart_currency=USD`  
- `_tracking_consent` (Shopify analytics)

## Proxy Requirements and Recommendations

### HTTP-First Analysis Results

Based on 100% HTTP success rate with real browser headers:

**Datacenter Proxies - RECOMMENDED**
- **Sufficient for this target** based on testing results
- **Cost-effective** solution for 781 products
- **No residential proxies required**
- **Providers**: OxyLabs, Bright Data datacenter pools

**Why Datacenter Proxies Work:**
1. Real browser headers bypass basic bot detection
2. No aggressive fingerprinting observed
3. Standard Cloudflare protection allows legitimate requests
4. Cost savings significant vs residential proxies

### Proxy Configuration Recommendations
```
Rotation: Every 50-100 requests
Geographic Distribution: US-based preferred  
Concurrent Connections: 5-10 maximum
Session Persistence: Not required
```

## Technical Implementation Recommendations

### Primary Approach: HTTP Requests with Real Headers

**Recommended Implementation:**
```python
headers = {
    'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/139.0.7258.5 Safari/537.36',
    'Accept': 'text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8',
    'Accept-Language': 'en-US,en;q=0.9',
    'Connection': 'keep-alive'
}
```

**Data Extraction Strategy:**
1. Parse JSON-LD structured data (primary source)
2. Extract OpenGraph meta tags (backup)  
3. Fallback to HTML parsing if needed (rarely required)

### Rate Limiting and Error Handling
- **Base Delay**: 500ms between requests
- **Exponential Backoff**: On 429/503 responses
- **Retry Logic**: 3 attempts with increasing delays
- **Circuit Breaker**: Pause scraping on consistent failures

### Monitoring and Maintenance
- **Success Rate Monitoring**: Alert if <95%
- **Response Time Tracking**: Baseline 2.5s average
- **Daily Sitemap Checks**: Monitor for new products
- **Header Refresh**: Update browser headers monthly

✓ **No CAPTCHA challenges** encountered  
✓ **Standard Shopify/Cloudflare** protection only  
✓ **Rich structured data** available server-side  
✓ **Predictable URL patterns** in sitemap  

### Potential Risk Factors
⚠️ **Cloudflare updates** could change protection level  
⚠️ **Rate limiting** may activate under high load  
⚠️ **IP blocking** possible with aggressive scraping  

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Maintain polite rate limiting** (2-3 RPS maximum)
2. **Regular header updates** from real browser sessions  
3. **Monitor for protection changes** in responses
4. **Rotate datacenter proxies** every 50-100 requests
5. **Implement graceful degradation** to browser automation if needed
