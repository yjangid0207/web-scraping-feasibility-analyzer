## Scraping Throughput Estimates

### HTTP Requests (Recommended Approach)
- **Success Rate**: 100% with real browser headers
- **Average Response Time**: 2.5 seconds per product
- **Estimated Scraping Time**: 
  - Sequential: ~32 minutes for all 781 products
  - Parallel (5 threads): ~6-8 minutes
  - Parallel (10 threads): ~4-5 minutes

### Rate Limiting Considerations
- No blocking observed during rapid testing (5 consecutive requests)
- Cloudflare protection present but allows legitimate requests
- Recommended rate: 2-3 requests per second to maintain stealth

## Data Completeness
Each product page contains rich structured data in JSON-LD format:
- Product name, description, brand
- Pricing information (USD)
- Variant details (colors, sizes)
- Stock availability status
- Product images and metadata
- Customer ratings and review counts

## Recommendations
1. **Prioritize HTTP scraping** - 100% success rate eliminates need for browser automation
2. **Use authentic browser headers** - Critical for bypassing basic bot detection
3. **Implement polite rate limiting** - 2-3 RPS recommended
4. **Monitor for changes** - Sitemap updates daily, track new products
5. **Focus on JSON-LD extraction** - Most efficient data source

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: HTTP approach with proper headers works consistently
- **Stable Infrastructure**: Shopify-based platform with predictable structure  
- **Minimal Anti-Bot Impact**: Standard Cloudflare protection, no aggressive blocking
