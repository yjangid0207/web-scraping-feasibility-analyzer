## Recommended Implementation Strategy

### Primary Approach: HTTP API Scraping
**Rationale**: Direct API access provides superior data quality and efficiency compared to HTML parsing.

**Implementation:**
1. **Sitemap Harvesting**: Extract all product SKUs from sitemap_products.xml
2. **Bulk API Queries**: Request 20-50 products per API call
3. **Store Rotation**: Collect data from multiple store locations
4. **Daily Updates**: Monitor sitemap for new products and changes

### Infrastructure Requirements

#### Proxy Setup: Datacenter Proxies (Cost-Effective)
- **Provider**: Bright Data or Oxylabs datacenter pools
- **IP Count**: 10-50 rotating IPs sufficient
- **Cost**: $200-500/month (significantly lower than residential)
- **Justification**: No bot detection means premium residential proxies unnecessary

#### Technical Specifications
- **Throughput**: 1,000-2,000 products/hour achievable
- **Concurrent Requests**: 5-10 per proxy IP
- **Resource Requirements**: Minimal server resources needed
- **Success Rate Expectation**: 95%+ based on testing

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks: LOW
- **API Stability**: Well-established endpoints with consistent structure
- **Access Restrictions**: No current protection, minimal future risk
- **Data Quality**: High consistency and reliability observed
- **Performance**: Robust infrastructure handles concurrent requests

### Compliance Considerations
- **Robots.txt Compliance**: Standard restrictions on search pages only
- **Public Data**: Product information is publicly accessible
- **Rate Respect**: Conservative request patterns planned
- **Terms Adherence**: Standard e-commerce data collection practices

## Investment Analysis

### Development Costs (Low)
- **Setup Time**: 1-2 weeks for complete implementation
- **Complexity**: Simple API integration, minimal custom parsing
- **Maintenance**: Low ongoing technical requirements
- **Infrastructure**: Standard web scraping stack sufficient

### Operational Costs (Low)
- **Proxy Costs**: $200-500/month (datacenter vs $2000+ residential)
- **Server Costs**: $100-200/month (standard VPS sufficient)
- **Maintenance**: <5 hours/month expected
- **Total Monthly**: $300-700 (vs $2000+ for complex targets)

### ROI Potential (High)
- **Data Volume**: 3,618 products × 28 fields = 101,304 data points
- **Update Frequency**: Daily data freshness achievable
- **Market Coverage**: National grocery chain with significant market share
- **Competitive Advantage**: Real-time pricing and inventory intelligence
