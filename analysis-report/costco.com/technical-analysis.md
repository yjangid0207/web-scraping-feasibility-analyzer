- **Geographic Distribution:** US-based IP addresses preferred
- **Quality:** High-trust IP addresses with clean reputation

### Performance Expectations
- **Throughput:** 50-100 products per hour per browser instance
- **Success Rate:** 85-95% with proper evasion techniques
- **Scalability:** Limited by detection risk - recommend 5-10 concurrent sessions maximum
- **Maintenance:** High - requires continuous monitoring and adaptation

## Risk Assessment

### Detection Probability
- **HTTP Requests:** 100% detection and blocking
- **Basic Browser Automation:** 90% detection within 10-20 requests
- **Advanced Evasion Techniques:** 15-25% detection risk
- **Recommended Approach:** 10-15% detection risk with proper implementation

### Blocking Consequences
- **IP Blocking:** Temporary to permanent IP-based restrictions
- **Behavioral Flagging:** Account-level restrictions for detected patterns
- **Rate Limiting:** Exponential backoff and throttling
