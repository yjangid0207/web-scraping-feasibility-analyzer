## Important Notes:
1. ALL URLs return JavaScript challenges when accessed via HTTP requests
2. Product URLs are dynamically generated and frequently change
3. API endpoints require valid browser sessions with CAPTCHA completion
4. Category and search pages use infinite scroll/lazy loading
5. Image URLs use dynamic parameters for size/quality optimization
6. Session tokens and verification codes change on every visit

## Scraping Implications:
- No static sitemap available due to JavaScript challenges
- Product discovery requires browser automation through category browsing
- URLs are not predictable and must be discovered dynamically
- All data extraction must be performed in browser automation context
- High infrastructure requirements due to anti-bot protection system
