- **Development Complexity:** Simple - standard HTTP client implementation
- **Maintenance Overhead:** Low - stable server-side rendering

**Cost Comparison:**
- **HTTP Approach:** ~$50-100/month for full monitoring
- **Browser Automation Alternative:** ~$500-1000/month (10x higher cost)

### ✅ Data Quality & Reliability

**Server-Side Rendered Content:**
- Complete product details (names, prices, descriptions)
- Real-time inventory and availability
- Multiple product images and specifications
- Customer reviews and ratings
- Related product recommendations

**No JavaScript Dependencies:**
- ✅ All data available in initial HTML response
- ✅ No dynamic loading or AJAX requirements
- ✅ Consistent data structure across all products
- ✅ Fast processing with minimal complexity

## Technical Feasibility

### ✅ Optimal HTTP Compatibility

**Enhanced Testing Methodology Results:**
- Phase 1: Extracted authentic browser headers via Playwright MCP
