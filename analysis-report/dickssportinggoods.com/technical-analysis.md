   - Scale gradually based on success rates
   - Implement comprehensive monitoring
   - Maintain proxy pool health actively

3. **Technical Implementation**
   - Use browser automation with human-like patterns
   - Implement session persistence and token management
   - Deploy on cloud infrastructure with auto-scaling
   - Establish 24/7 monitoring and maintenance

### Alternative Considerations
- **API Investigation**: Research potential undocumented APIs
